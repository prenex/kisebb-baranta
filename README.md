# kisebb-baranta
An everyday man's 40-day excercise in life - done according to old Hungarian values.

This is a modified and even smaller version of "kisbaranta" done earlier.

If you want to do a similar one, you can clone the very first commit and change the columns!

## Reasoning for the cause

As is visible from the last attempt, certain changes are made to make things smaller and more easy to do completely - I still does not expect this will be done completely even in this form.

Also look for the real one here:

## 40-day long excercise of the soul, mind and body

The excercise will took 40 days for which a calendar-like structure is presented here. The first week is a truncated week on which excercise starts only on wednesday - according to the traditional catholic fasting before Easter.

The excercise plan consists of daily activities in a grid structure - either done or not on that day.

For the this I will present a calendar-like structure in which the continuous day to day tasks will be listed as columns and the days as rowns. The 'O' character in a row/column pair represents the thing has not been done (yet) and an 'X' means it has been done. The columns I use are specific to my case, so feel free to change them according to your needs.

If the system is used over github - as in my case - and you try to adhere to pushing changes every day the github indicator will be a very good indicator about how well or badly this system is followed.

	Hét - Easter (Just be happy and celebrate God here whatever happens)

The above should be understood as:

* **SleepOK** - I can tick this if I went to sleep early that day. Usually ticked the next day (postmortem).
* **Workout** - Pushups, sit-ups, lean-backs or even using weights
* **Run** - Running at least 2km or more. Can be four too.
* **Thesis** - Writing my thesis (it is a different topic now, but still not done!)
* **Dev** - Either one of: Working on my own AR glasses or its software; Working on my dream computer; or writing other productive code
* **House** - Doing any kind of work on my house that I am renovating. It can be ANY from the smallest work to biggest ones.
* **Girlfr.** - Trying to greet her, connect to her, make her day more happy. She has a lot to do so this is hard, but I can make my part.
* **Book** - Writing into my book
* **Guitar** - Play some guitar. It can be any small amount!

### Pointing system

The points after your kisbaranta consists of the base- and duplicate-points:

* You get a single points for every 'X' in the table (**BASE POINTS**)
* Some of the 'X's can be counted more than once (**DUPLICATE POINTS**)

For **DUPLICATE POINTS** you can count an 'X' multiple times as follows:

1. When every column has an 'X' in a row, count those 'X's one more time!
2. When every row in a week has an 'X' in a column, count those 'X's one more time!
3. When every spot has an 'X' for a whole week everywhere, count those 'X's two more time!
4. When every spot has an 'X' in the whole table, multiply your points from 1-3 with the number of the columns.

When both rules apply, you get both duplicate points added to your base point!

This pointing system approximates the "experience points" you gain through 
your kisbaranta and tries to force you to continue your work even if you 
miss some or many of your goals for a short period of time. Also considering 
that these points measure experience and strenght you have gained, they are 
always positive - even if you have got only one point (surely you get more)!
